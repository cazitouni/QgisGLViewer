## Plugin usage

### Global usage 

To use this plugin, simply fill in your database connection and/or geopackage and define the related columns:

- **Geometry column**: the geometry column of the point table
- **Direction column**: image starting direction in north angle where 0-360 is north
- **Link column**: link to the image, could be a directory or a web URL
- **Date column**: date the image was taken

Once the parameters are filled in, simply click on the point position on the map and drag the cursor to the direction you want, and the image will load, no need to load the point layer in your project.

The plugin also offer the ability to jump to different images, you only have to click on the image in the direction you want.
The gap parameter could be set to change the jump distance (in meters), by default it's set to 5.

In addition it's possible for the user to press the **C** key to make a crosshair appear on the image.
